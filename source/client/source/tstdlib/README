This library is intended to be used as a mechanism to make the TCHAR type play nice with the standard library where proper. Mostly, it defines a namespace called tstd that contains lookalike symbols to the standard library iostream and string objects, but using tchar instead of seperate objects for char and wchar.

You cannot, for ambiguity reasons, using this namespace wholesale in a scope where you have usinged the std namespace, as that creates ambiguity. Renaming stuff in here to t* instead of just mimicing the name given to the char version in the std namespace would make this possible and may be a wise thing to do for other reasons in the long run.
